Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams.
Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
Apache Flink is an open source platform for distributed stream and batch data processing.
Flink's core is a streaming dataflow engine that provides data distribution, communication, and fault tolerance for distributed computations over data streams.
Flink includes several APIs for creating applications that use the Flink engine:
DataStream API for unbounded and bounded streams
DataSet API for bounded data sets
Table API with SQL-like expression language
Primitives for Graph Processing

These APIs offer different levels of abstraction and tradeoffs between ease of use and expressiveness.
Apache Flink excels at processing unbounded and bounded data sets.
Unbounded streams have a start but no defined end.
Bounded streams have defined start and end.
Any kind of data is a stream: events, logs, objects, files, database changes.
Apache Flink can be deployed on various resource providers like YARN, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes.
